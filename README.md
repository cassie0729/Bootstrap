# Bootstrap
Project: Exploring principal components analysis via bootstrap methods (Faculty Mentor: Miles Lopes, Statistics)

Principal components analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used tools for data analysis. In essence, it is concerned with extracting information from the eigenvalues/vectors of covariance matrices, and using this information to represent data in a way that is easier to understand. In particular, it is important to construct confidence intervals for the unknown eigenvalues of the true covariance matrix associated with the data. To construct these intervals in practice, it is common to use "bootstrap methods", but it is sometimes hard to know when these methods actually work. In this project, the student will carry out numerical experiments to investigate situations where bootstrap methods are not well understood. Prerequisites: The student needs to be comfortable with a programming language such as R, Python, or Matlab. Also, it would be very helpful for the student to have taken STA 135 (Multivariate Data Analysis). Anticipated number of students: 1.
